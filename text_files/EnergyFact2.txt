Wind Energy: Global wind capacity has been growing rapidly, with global wind power capacity exceeding 1,000 GW by 2023. Wind energy avoids about 1.5 billion tons of CO2 emissions annually.
Solar Energy: Solar power has also grown significantly. The total installed global solar capacity will reach 1,100 GW by 2023, and solar energy avoids about 1 billion tons of CO2
emissions annually.
Hydropower: Contributes about 16% of global electricity generation, producing nearly zero CO2 emissions during operation. 
However, the environmental impact of dam construction and ecosystem disruption can have other environmental consequences.
