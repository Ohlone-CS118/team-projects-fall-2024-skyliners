# preconditions: assumes that the $a, and $f registers have already been saved
# postcondition: the total energy emission for the weekday is stored in $f0
# Contributors: Emma. 12/02/2024(wrote the subroutine) - 12/04/2024(error checking)
# Purpose: Gives prompts and calculates the carbon emission of the weekday energy questions
